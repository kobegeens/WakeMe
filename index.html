  <h1>WakeMe</h1>
    <h3>Hey!</h3>
    <p>This is the site for my app called WakeMe. Both the site and app are still in development.</p>
    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>WakeMe is an open-source alarm clock app for Android with privacy in mind.</p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>I needed a project to participate in the Neighboord program by Hack Club, and this seemed like something that could be made fairly simple, but with enough time could also grow into a fully fledged app with lots of functions.</p>
